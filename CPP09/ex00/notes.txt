C++ streams are considered type-safe - meaning that extraction to variables are limited to that variable type
ex:
	std::string dateString = "2024-01-14";
	std::istringstream ss(dateString);
	char dash;
	ss >> dateStruct.tm_year >> dash >> dateStruct.tm_mon >> dash >> dateStruct.tm_mday;
	dateStruct.tm_year will only take integers and stops when it encounters a nondata character

Parsing:
dates must be correct
numbers must be between 0 and 1000 (int or float)

in input.txt
check if date is valid
	-is date a real date
	-is it between first and last values in data.csv
check if value is valid
	-number must be between 0 and 1000
check string
	-if there are doubles or incorrect characters

.csv file
use map -> time struct and number
if anything is incorrect, throw error and shut down program
alternatively, process line by line, and skip whichever lines are invalid
