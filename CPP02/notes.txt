A copy constructor is used to init an object with an existing object of the same type 
ExampleClass (const ExampleClass& exClass) -> it contains a reference to the same class
call with ExampleClass copyClass {existingObject};
use =delete if you want to supress a copy constructor (object cannot be copied

copy assignment operator (=) -> used to copy values from one object to another existing object
basically like a copy constructor except its for something that already exists
must be overloaded as  member function
exampleClass& operator = const exampleClass& exampleclass

static variables are used for the entire class rather than for individual instances of each class
has to be initiated inside declaration of class rather than in constructor

bitwise operation cannot be applied to floats
left bit shift = * 2^n
right bit shift = / 2^n
operators like << must be implemented as a friend fucntion bc they convert one or both operands
